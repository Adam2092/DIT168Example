## Purpose of this folder

This exampleDIT168 folder contains only source files that are used exclusively for the demonstration in the lecture session on Fri. 2 Mar. 2018.

The codes and scripts could (and should) be compiled and run without dependency of current opendlv.scaledcars repository. Only the Docker image "seresearch/2018-dit-168:v0.3.5-armhf" is required, as it provides proxy "opendlv-proxy-miniature-pwm-motor" as well as the odsupercomponent.
